    <h2>Visualizing an Edge Computing Architecture</h2>
    <h1>Edge computing moves data processing and storage closer to applications and client devices by leveraging tiered, 
        <br>edge data centers – along with embedded data storage directly on devices where appropriate.</h1>
    
    <h1>This tiered approach insulates applications from central and regional data center outages. 
        <br>Each tier leverages increasingly local connectivity – which is more reliable – and synchronizes data within and 
        <br>across tiers as connectivity permits. Edge computing is how you power always-fast, always-on applications.</h1>
    <div class="wrapper">
        <h1>I like to visualize edge architectures as a set of layers, which makes the concept easier to understand. Take a look at the diagram 
            <br>below:</h1>
        <img class="img-diagram" src="edgecomputingdiagram.png" alt="diagram">
    </div>
    <h1>In the diagram above, the top layer represents cloud data centers, comprised of a central data center and interconnected regional data centers. 
        <br>The cloud data centers still serve a crucial role in an edge computing architecture because they’re the final repository of information. However, 
        <br>cloud data centers aren’t relied upon for local applications.</h1>
    <h1>The next layer down is the edge layer. The edge could be an oil platform, as in our earlier example, but it could just as easily be a cruise liner, 
        <br>airplane, restaurant, retail shop or mobile medical clinic. The edge layer contains edge data centers and Internet of Things (IoT) gateways. 
        <br>These run on a local area network, which could be fiber, wireless, 5G or older networks such as 4G and earlier.</h1>
    <h1>Within the edge layer, you see individual devices, smart phones, tablets and laptops carried by users, as well as IoT devices that all communicate 
        <br>with the edge data center. There is also communication between devices via a private area network such as RF or Bluetooth.</h1>
    <h1>While this depiction shows a single edge data center for simplicity, there could be n number of additional edge data centers to facilitate computing 
        <br>across a business ecosystem. For example, you might power POS systems for a chain of retail stores using edge data centers in each city where stores 
        <br>are concentrated.</h1>
