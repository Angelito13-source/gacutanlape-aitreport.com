    <h2>What is Edge Computing?</h2>
    <h1>Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage 
        closer to the sources of data. <br>This is expected to improve response times and save bandwidth. 
        The term refers to an architecture rather than a specific technology.</h1>
    
    <h1>Connected homes</h1>
    <h1>Autonomous vehicles</h1>
    <h1>Robotic surgery</h1>
    <h1>Advanced real-time gaming</h1>
    <h1>Edge computing is an alternative architecture to cloud computing for applications that require high-speed and high availability. 
        <br>This is because apps that rely solely on the cloud for storing and processing data become dependent on internet connectivity
        <br> â€“ and therefore subject to its inherent unreliability. When the internet slows or becomes unavailable, 
        <br>the entire application slows or fails in turn.</h1>
        <h1>Edge computing gets around internet dependencies by locating data as close as possible to where it is produced and consumed, 
        <br>which speeds up applications and improves their availability.</h1>
